Hello 👋, My name is Hessel!
I am a 20 year old web developer from The Netherlands that loves to make websites with laravel/php, Vue, Nuxt & tailwindcss.
I also like to make discord bots using discord js.

Since 2018 I started learning php and laravel. In 2021 is started learning Tailwindcss and Vue.js 
My goal with making websites is to help other people out with something they want to achieve
but simply can't without a website.

What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently besides from still learning more about laravel, I also started learning Vue.js
since Javascript is very popular these days and its something that's used a lot in web development.

Projects i've published so far:

Grrp.me:
https://www.grrp.me

Grrp.me is a website where user can create a profile and start posting important links on their profile
they can then paste their Grrp.me profile link bio on instagram or on other social media platforms.
Its basically linktree but cooler in my opinion 😄
